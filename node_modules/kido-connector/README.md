# Base module for Kidozen's connectors
The module was created as part of [KidoZen](http://www.kidozen.com) project.

If you are new to connectors, please feel free to read the [Getting Started Guide](https://bitbucket.org/tellagostudios/kido-connector/src/master/getting_started/README.md)

See the file [sample.js](https://bitbucket.org/tellagostudios/kido-connector/src/master/sample.js) for a sample of how a connector based on `kido-connector` should look like.
